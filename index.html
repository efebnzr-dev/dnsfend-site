        <div class="threat-grid">
            <div class="threat-item">
                <h3>As organizations move forward with digitalization, internet security has become more important than
                    ever.</h3>
                <p>As organizations take major steps toward digital transformation, internet security has become more
                    important than ever.

                    Employees access company resources, accounting and finance software, ERP, SAP, CRM, and other
                    critical systems over the internet.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    However, during this process, the number of cyber threats faced by organizations is rapidly
                    increasing. These threats bring risks such as data breaches, system disruptions, and the compromise
                    of corporate networks, laboratory environments, and user data through malicious software.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Providing a secure and uninterrupted digital experience is no longer a luxury it is a
                    <b>necessity</b>.

        <h2 id="core-features">DNS-Based Cyber Threats</h2>
        <p>
            DNS plays a vital role in managing internet traffic and unfortunately becomes a target for many cyber
            attacks.
            If DNS attacks are not prevented, they put your network security and personal data at risk.
        </p>

        <div class="threat-cards">
            <div class="threat-item">
                <h3>DNS Tunneling Attacks</h3>
                <p>
                    Cybercriminals use DNS tunneling to transport malicious data and enable data theft. This technique
                    exploits DNS to exfiltrate sensitive information from your network.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="threat-item">
                <h3>DNS Poisoning</h3>
                <p>
                    DNS poisoning redirects users to fraudulent websites to steal credentials. Users are deceived into
                    visiting fake sites that appear legitimate.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="threat-item">
                <h3>Phishing Attacks</h3>
                <p>
                    Phishing attacks lure users to deceptive websites to obtain personal information. These targeted
                    attacks
                    often appear to come from trusted sources.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="threat-item">
                <h3>Botnet Command & Control</h3>
                <p>
                    Compromised machines communicate with command and control servers. DNSFEND blocks these
                    communications
                    before they can cause damage.
                </p>

            <div class="threat-item">
                <h3>Malware Distribution</h3>
                <p>
                    Malware-hosting servers use DNS to deliver infections. We block access to known malware distribution
                    points.
                </p>

            <div class="threat-item">
                <h3>Ransomware Attacks</h3>
                <p>
                    Ransomware uses DNS to contact command centers. DNSFEND prevents communication and stops infections
                    early.
